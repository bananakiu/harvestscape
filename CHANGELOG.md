# HarvestScape — Change Log

> **This is the single, internal source of truth for every change to the game.**
> There is intentionally no separate public-facing log — this one covers everything:
> features, balance tweaks, bug fixes, UX polish, and the *design decisions* behind them.
>
> **Why this exists:** to be a complete audit trail of what we changed and *why*, so the
> whole game can be handed to another AI agent later and rebuilt — possibly in a different
> engine or a different direction — with full knowledge of the reasoning that shaped it.
> A one-line "fixed lighting" is useless for that; every entry should say **what** changed
> and **why** it was the right call.
>
> **Conventions**
> - Newest first. Group each batch under a dated heading; note the commit once known.
> - Prefer *why over what*. The diff already records what; this records intent.
> - `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Design` / `Balance` sub-headings as useful.
> - Update this file in the *same* change as the code, then commit and push (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## [Unreleased] — Lighting & readability polish · 2026-07-11

Player-facing complaints about visibility, resolved with the Stardew philosophy that a
cozy night should be *readably dim*, not black-with-a-spotlight.

### Changed
- **Night lighting overhaul (glare → clarity).** The surface at night was near-black
  (ambient `#11163a`, ~9% brightness) with the player emitting a big cold-blue additive
  "searchlight" (`200,215,255`, r52) that bloomed into glare over the void. Three fixes,
  all in `game/js/06-weather.js` `drawLighting`/`collectLights`:
  1. **Lifted the night ambient floor** toward moonlit blue `#464c6a`, scaled by
     `nightFactor` so dusk eases in gently. The whole valley is now dimly readable — soil
     rows, fences, trees all visible — which also removes the extreme contrast that made
     any light look like a harsh spotlight. *This is the real clarity win.* Outdoor-only.
  2. **Turned the player's surface light into a warm lantern aura** (`255,226,178`, r42,
     i0.55) instead of a cold blue searchlight. Reads as "carrying a lantern," not glare.
  3. **Reshaped the light gradient** (3 stops → 4: softer `0.44` core, fuller `0.34` mid,
     quicker tail) so lights are *defined pools* that don't white out detail underneath.
     Applied globally; verified it did not dim the mine or interiors.
- **Mine lighting (was too dark to play).** Ambient `#39344a`→`#5b5568`, vignette eased
  to `0.18` underground, player torch radius `68`→`98`. Ore/crystals/gems are now legible
  while the far corners stay dark and atmospheric. *Design intent: dim but readable — you
  can always see the ore you came down to swing at.*

### Added
- **High-fidelity text overlay** (`game/js/05-particles.js`, `#gtext` canvas in
  `index.html`). Floaters, prompts (`E`, `!`, ladder arrows), and name tags were drawn on
  the 320px internal canvas and upscaled ~4×, so all game text looked mushy. They now draw
  to a separate device-resolution overlay and render crisp, à la Stardew's high-fidelity
  UI text over pixel-art world. `queueText`/`flushText`/`syncTextLayer` API.
- **Pickup log** (`game/js/10-ui.js` `notePickup`, `#pickups` in `index.html`/CSS). A
  fading, roll-up notification in the corner when items are collected. *Why:* satisfying
  collection feedback, and it fixed the item-text/XP-text overlap (`+2 Wood` colliding with
  `+25 wood` into garbled `+252 woodd`). Item name moved out of the world floater into the
  log; floaters got anti-overlap nudging.

### Design
- **Design scorecard re-audit** (`DESIGN_SCORECARD.md`): re-graded the v2.0 build against
  `GAME_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, **B+ → A−**, reflecting the economy, depth, and story work
  that shipped since the original audit.

## v1.4 – v2.0 — "A Day Worth Living" · 2026-07-10 · commit `5e52483`

Three design iterations shipped together. Core problem diagnosed by a grounding pass that
measured the actual loop: **sleep-skip was the dominant strategy and starfruit was a
passive ~3,100g/day money printer** — the day had no reason to be *lived*. These features
give the day texture and make presence matter.

### v2.0 — systems that reward showing up
- **Tom's Demand (market saturation).** Selling many of one item the same day drives its
  price down (`DEMAND` decay/floor, value-scaled free allowance, overnight recovery). Kills
  the monocrop-printer; rewards diversified farming. *(Later retuned — see Scorecard P1.)*
- **Hoe tiers + honest snow.** Bigger hoes till in shapes; winter snow actually blocks
  tilling until cleared, so the season reads as a real constraint.
- **Forecast + the Day's Offering.** A readable weather forecast and a rotating daily
  request give a reason to plan tomorrow and check in today.
- **The Hunt.** Fishing gained *places, hours, and 5 legendary fish* with real conditions —
  turning fishing from a slot machine into an expedition. Capstone reward: Bram's Oilskin.
- **Orchard + Apiary.** Fruit trees and beehives: slow, permanent, tend-over-time income
  that rewards commitment to a plot rather than churn.

### v1.5 — the valley fills in (6 steps)
- Watering-can tiers + an economy/season balance patch.
- **Grandpa's Journal Pages** (9) — collectible lore that threads the story.
- **Village Noticeboard** — standing requests from townsfolk.
- **Mastery milestones** at skill 25/50/75/99 — payoff across the long 1–99 curve.
- **Rowan's Restoration Projects** — spend resources to restore the valley (the Ledger).

### v1.4 — audit fixes + Act Two story
- Fixes from three parallel code audits; synthesized design spec built out.
- **Act Two** narrative added (`game/js/14-story.js`, +864 lines): heart events, capstones.

### Fixed (in this commit)
- **Mine ladder softlock:** ~1.3% of floors walled off the down-ladder. Added BFS
  reachability repair + an approach guard in `genMine`.
- **Door-approach softlock:** permanent trees could wall off the cottage door. Added a
  `nearDoorway` guard and `digUp` (Axe removes trees/hives).
- **Lightning flash freeze:** `_flash` froze behind menus; now decays while paused/blocked,
  alpha capped low (a glimmer, never a whiteout).

## Scorecard fixes — 2026-07-10 (folded into `5e52483` / polish pass)

Implementing Fable 5's `DESIGN_SCORECARD.md` feedback, ranked P1–P6.
- **P1 — Retune Tom's Demand.** The first cut left a drip-seller at ~96% price and had an
  inverted comment. Fixed: value-scaled free allowance, overnight halving (drip → ~79%),
  floor `0.35`, blended sell-all pricing.
- **P2 — Show next unlock.** Skills panel now previews the next unlock at each level.
- **P3 — Bank mine depth + deepen ore.** Checkpoint every 5 floors; ore table richens with
  depth and drops stone past floor 6 — the mine feels like a descent, not a flat faucet.
- **P4 — Audio pass + lightning cap.** SFX polish; lightning alpha capped at `0.22`.
- **P5 — Gift first sapling.** Pip gifts the player their first fruit-tree sapling.
- **P6 — Crown the Hunt.** 5/5 legendary capstone rewards Bram's Oilskin (storm fishing).
- Also fixed in passing: missing `door` SFX (silent travel); `TOM_GLUT` `{item}` only
  replaced the first of two placeholders (→ global regex); fish above ~lvl 36 were
  mathematically uncatchable (`DIFF_MAX` hard-clamped to `1.20`).

## Design & reference docs

- **2026-07-10 · `97f2b8a`** — `DESIGN_SCORECARD.md`: Fable 5's audit of the build against
  the principles doc (original grade **B+**).
- **2026-07-10 · `3ad3a70`** — `GAME_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`: the design bible — cozy
  contract, RuneScape-layer goals, tone rules. The yardstick every audit grades against.
- Also in-tree (uncommitted planning at various points): `DESIGN_V1.5.md`,
  `ROADMAP_V2.html`, `DESIGN_REVIEW.md`, `GAME_SCOPE.md`.

## v1.0 — Initial build · 2026-07-09 · commit `ec19013`

The whole game, from scratch, 100% procedural — no asset files of any kind.

### Architecture (load-bearing context for any future rebuild)
- **15 plain `<script>` files sharing one global scope.** No modules, no build step, no
  libraries. Load order matters (`00-core` → `14-story` → `12-game`); cross-file calls
  resolve at runtime because function declarations hoist. See `game/index.html`.
- **All art is canvas pixel art** drawn in code (`game/js/03-art.js`, `px()` rects,
  `mkSpr`). **All audio is WebAudio synthesis** (`game/js/02-audio.js`). Nothing is loaded
  from disk — the game is self-contained JS.
- **Rendering:** internal 320×208 canvas, `imageSmoothingEnabled=false`, CSS-upscaled ~4×
  with `image-rendering:pixelated`. Camera transform in `renderWorld`; lighting composited
  via multiply (ambient) + `lighter` (lights) + vignette passes in `drawLighting`.
- **Persistence:** only `state.farm` persists (localStorage); interiors/mine/beach
  regenerate daily from `mapCache` (cleared nightly). `migrateSave` backfills new fields.

### Design identity (do not break without cause)
- **No combat, ever.** Cozy tone — *nothing is ever taken from the player.* The mine, the
  storms, low energy: all non-hazardous by deliberate design.
- **Stardew Valley × RuneScape:** the cozy farming base plus a real 1–99 skill grind. The
  standing tension the audits track is keeping the RuneScape layer as rich as the cozy base.

### Core systems at v1.0
- Farming (till/plant/water/harvest), fishing, mining, foraging.
- Skills with a 1–99 curve; NPCs, gifting, dialogue, quests/journal.
- Day/night cycle, weather, four seasons, festivals, birthdays.
